## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **🔍 Scroll Detection**

function detectCurrentSection() {
  const sections = [
    { id: 'hero', element: document.querySelector('.hero-section, #hero') },
    { id: 'projects', element: document.querySelector('.projects-section, #projects') },
    { id: 'skills', element: document.querySelector('.skills-section, #skills') },
    // ...
  ]
  
  // 30% viewport threshold for smooth detection
  const threshold = window.innerHeight * 0.3
  // Check which section is currently visible
}
```

### **🎤 Speech Integration**
```javascript
// ElevenLabs TTS integration
async function speakMessage(text: string) {
  await elevenLabsTTS.speak(text, {
    voiceId: '21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM', // Rachel
    stability: 0.6,
    similarityBoost: 0.8,
    style: 0.3, // Add personality
    useSpeakerBoost: true
  })
}
```

### **🎯 Smart Movement**
```javascript
// Section-specific positioning
const positions = {
  hero: { x: window.innerWidth - 100, y: 100 },
  projects: { x: 50, y: window.innerHeight / 2 - 100 },
  skills: { x: window.innerWidth - 100, y: window.innerHeight / 2 },
  canvas: { x: window.innerWidth / 2 - 25, y: 50 },
